Welcome to the Final Project
or this year called the dix-sept-erledigt.

After you figure out what you are going to be doing, 
--and who is part of your squad, 
--create groups on git and
--get to learning and planning

Create some goals and milestones in git.

I would like to connect you with a programmer from the wild.
So, I need to know what you are thinking, and have a paragraph description of your project to share.
We have a draft to match mentors and groups, so make it compelling.

                                 /////// Goal /////////
	
	Our team's goal for our final project is to create a fun and intuitive bingo game.  
	This game will incorporate an int array being filled with an either random numbers
	or the user creating their own board.  From there, we will "grab" random numbers from
	a generator and fill in the user's board.  We will then determine if the user has 
	a bingo.   That is our initial goal.  To go above and beyond, we would consider 
	users and storing their high score and their name.
